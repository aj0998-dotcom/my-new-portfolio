## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- npm 9+ (or compatible)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd 3d-portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`  
  Starts Vite dev server and exposes host for local network testing.

- `npm run build`  
  Type-checks and builds a production-ready bundle.

- `npm run preview`  
  Serves the production build locally for verification.

- `npm run lint`  
  Runs ESLint checks across the project.

## GSAP License Note

This project uses the standard `gsap` package, including bonus plugins now available in the core package.

- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- If migrating from older setups, remove `gsap-trial` from your project.

Read official installation guidance here: [GSAP Installation Docs](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/)

## Customization Guide

You can adapt this portfolio to your own profile by updating the following areas:

- **Content sections**: Edit files in `src/components/` such as `About.tsx`, `Career.tsx`, `WhatIDo.tsx`, and `Work.tsx`.
- **Data source**: Update static values in files under `src/data/`.
- **Styling**: Modify component styles in `src/components/styles/` and global styles in `src/index.css` / `src/App.css`.
- **3D scene behavior**: Adjust scene logic in `src/components/Character/` and related utilities.
- **Animations**: Tweak GSAP utilities under `src/components/utils/`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank screen in development**  
  Check browser console for module import errors and verify all dependencies are installed.

- **3D performance issues on low-end devices**  
  Reduce scene complexity and post-processing effects in the character/scene utilities.

- **GSAP plugin errors**  
  Ensure you have the correct plugin package and license configuration for your target environment.

- **TypeScript build failures**  
  Run `npm run build` and address reported type errors before deploying.

## Deployment

1. Create a production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Validate locally:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. Deploy the generated `dist/` folder to your hosting provider (for example Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages).

Triggering a GitHub -> Vercel deploy

If your repository is connected to Vercel (recommended), pushing to the branch configured in Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment. To update GitHub and trigger a redeploy, run:

```bash
# stage changes
git add -A

# commit with a helpful message
git commit -m "style(work): themed project image container + Work section tweaks"

# push to your default branch (replace `main` if your repo uses a different branch)
git push origin main
```

If your repository isn't connected to Vercel yet, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub repository and push the project (see commands above).
2. In the Vercel dashboard, click "Import Project" → select GitHub → choose your repository.
3. Configure the build command (`npm run build`) and the output directory (`dist`), then click "Deploy".

Notes
- After pushing to GitHub, Vercel will pick up the commit and start a deploy automatically (if linked).
- You can view deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard for troubleshooting.

Files changed in this workspace to support the Work section visuals:
- `src/components/styles/Work.css` — added themed container, image filters, and hover effect for project images.
